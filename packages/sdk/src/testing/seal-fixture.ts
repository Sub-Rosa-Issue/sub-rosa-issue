// Offline sealed-bid fixtures for the SDK tests.
//
// A real seal, produced without a network. `timelockEncrypt` reads exactly one
// thing from the Drand client — `chain().info()` — and only to learn the
// chain's static public key, which is a constant of quicknet. Stubbing that
// call therefore yields genuine tlock ciphertext, so the pre-commit gate is
// tested against the real sealer instead of a hand-written stand-in that could
// drift from it.
//
// This is test-only scaffolding: it is not exported from the package index, and
// nothing in `src` outside `*.test.ts` imports it.
